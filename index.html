    <p>My name is David Vallejo and I am currently in the Rutgers Coding Training Bootcamp. I am a Montclair State University graduate from 2014. I currently work at Hackensack Meridian Health Hospital as a Community Health Worker. In my own time, I love to play basketball, collect comics and go nature walking. My goal is to gain as much knowledge as possible during this bootcamp. There will be many challenges ahead of me but I'm excited. </p>

<p>I also own two cats. Their names are Luna and Patches. Luna is the mother and Patches is her daughter. I enjoy eating pizza at any time and any place. I truly think it's the bes thing ever created. Thinking about it has me hungry. Anyways, take a look at my portfolio. I hope you enjoy!</p>
